Applechess is a simple chess engine, written using the minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms along with a handcrafted heuristics function.

See more information about the two algorithms on the Wikipedia pages: `minimax <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax>`_ and `alpha-beta pruning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning>`_.
